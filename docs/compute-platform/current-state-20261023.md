# Current platform state — 23 October 2026

The full platform remains **limited-pilot**, not production qualified. The
ordinary `cps:shared-gpu-lab` 5 GiB lifecycle now passes on the durable authority,
including automatic KAI reservation cleanup. This supersedes earlier pending
statements for that specific lifecycle, not every production acceptance gate.

## Newly verified live results

- CPS and CIT use the matching Hub image `435c0806…e5cb466`. The Hub wheel is
  based on the deployed source plus the durable receipt-root configuration change;
  unrelated lifetime and UI modules were preserved. Its 33 configuration tests pass.
- Gateway `3c8030cc…2287624` and Node `9d998baa…047bbeb` use the durable
  `cps-native-runtime` authority. Both control-service image rotations preserved
  the original delivery journal anchor and publication history. Predecessor
  bootstrap inputs remain available; the journal was not reset.
- The startup gate mounts the authority's public receipt/authority directories
  read-only from durable storage. Two initializers completed successfully before
  the actual notebook container became Ready.
- Two sequential normal starts on binder `218f788e…61800a1` took 84.49 and
  86.03 seconds. Actual notebook CUDA execution passed; a 6 GiB allocation was
  rejected under the automatic 5 GiB cap and subsequent allocation recovered.
  A workspace file survived normal shutdown/restart; the owned QA probe was removed.
- Normal stops took 15.11 and 6.96 seconds. KAI deleted the corresponding GPU
  reservation Pods automatically 2.36 and 3.41 seconds after close. The elected
  binder Pod did not restart and no reservation was manually deleted in either cycle.
- Final readback: workspace stopped, no active member reservations, all nine
  current-authority native claims released, no KAI reservation Pods, no online
  kernel cap entries. No MIG, driver, kernel, reset or storage-address change occurred.

[Live cleanup and repeat-start evidence](../../platform-staging/scheduler/native-kai-binder/cleanup-exact-retry-20261023/live-qualification.json)
and [earlier durable-root lifecycle evidence](../../platform-staging/gpu/qualification/native-fresh-unequal/results/normal-shared-gpu-durable-root-lifecycle-20261023.json)
retain the measured scope and identities. The first cleanup candidate was rejected
and replaced by a build from the exact recorded deployed binder patch; its failure
is retained in the adjacent candidate verification record.

## Full-plan completion order

The [original acceptance ledger](production-completion-20261013.md#acceptance-ledger)
and [required scenarios](qualification.md) remain binding. Older passing evidence
is retained; it is not reclassified as wholly untested. The final release matrix
must distinguish that evidence from the current live checks above.

1. The console startup confirmation fix is deployed to CPS/CIT. Normal GPU start
   (99.66 s), normal shutdown and pending-start cancellation passed live; focused
   tests cover lost reservations at final readiness publication. See the
   [package and live verification](../../platform-staging/admin/qualification/start-confirmation-20261023/verification.json).
   Confirm actual lifetime/idle expiry and advance warnings next; startup success
   and valid deadline telemetry alone do not prove deadline enforcement.
2. Complete ordinary-user CPS/CIT access and the remaining collaboration gates:
   current SDK/Compute/RTC variants, membership removal closing existing access,
   and populated archive/recovery scenarios. A dedicated CPU fixture now passes
   normal closure, server-enforced read-only archive and blocked restart;
   [archive acceptance](../../platform-staging/admin/qualification/archive-identifiers-20261023/verification.json)
   retains the scope. CPS CPU connected-visitor revocation now passes: an existing Armin WebSocket
   closed, then restart returned Armin 403 and Mikasa 200. Populated test-file
   archive retention and EROFS passed independently. See
   [connected-member evidence](../../platform-staging/admin/qualification/member-revocation-20261023/verification.json).
   Equivalent CIT/GPU removal remains separate. Prior visitor/RTC
   and local-provider acceptance remains in the historical ledger.
3. Complete the current notebook/batch authorization matrix: immutable snapshots,
   typed parameters, selected imports, success/failure artifacts, ownership and
   crafted request rejection. Retain independent CPU/batch permissions while a
   shared interactive allowance is held; qualify distributed launchers before enabling them.
4. Finish broader GPU scheduling/packing, teaching reclaim, checkpoint/distributed
   cleanup, representative CPS/CIT startup bursts and the Descheduler comparison.
   These two warm single-workspace starts do not establish burst p95, eight-GPU
   capacity, ordinary 20 GiB access or a whole-pool MPS qualification. Existing
   controlled unequal-cap/import/MPS/peer-survival results retain their bounded scope.
5. Verify monitoring completeness and stale-data presentation, matching-version
   backups and actual restores, NFS archives, and artifact ownership/retention on
   the final application matrix. NFS addresses remain unchanged and the accepted
   NetBird relay path remains the S3 transport choice.
6. Integrate the tested application/deployment branches and exact image/policy
   compatibility matrix. Publish and promote pilot, candidate and production
   artifacts only after their respective gates pass; account for Fleet deployment
   on merge. Published candidate images are not production releases.

Local course management stays active. Moodle remains visibly planned, disabled
and inert. Direct university OAuth awaits ICT registration as explicitly deferred;
email verification remains optional. These decisions are not silently expanded
into additional production requirements or identity linkage by username.
