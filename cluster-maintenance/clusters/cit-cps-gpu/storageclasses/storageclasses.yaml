# Note: Storage classes are already configured and managed outside of Fleet
# Both nfs-client and fast-scratch storage classes exist and are working properly
# Removing them from Fleet management to avoid conflicts

# nfs-client - managed by nfs-subdir-external-provisioner Helm chart in nfs-provisioner namespace
# fast-scratch - created via kubectl apply
